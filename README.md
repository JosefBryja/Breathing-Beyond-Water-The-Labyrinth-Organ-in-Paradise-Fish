## The Adaptability of Pharyngeal Arches: Labyrinth Organ
Neural crest cells played a crucial role in the evolution of pharyngeal
arches, which are essential for the development of various tissue
structures. While gills are a common example, the paradise fish
(*Macropodus opercularis*) possesses a unique and fascinating
adaptation: the labyrinth organ. This specialized structure, derived from
the first gill-bearing arch, allows for aerial breathing.

Gas exchange, along with predation, appears to be one of the driving
forces of vertebrate evolution. This evolutionary pressure has led to the
development of unique cell types in the labyrinth organ across species.
These include “valve cells” and pillar cells, which are thought to be
essential for proper endothelial function, as well as a specialized
respiratory epithelium.

## MicroCT Analysis Shows Post-Metamorphosis Development of Labyrinth Organ
- Labyrinth organ is unique in its development after metamorphosis
- MicroCT measurements show the dynamics of these changes

**Conclusion:** Labyrinth organ forms after metamorphosis.


## Histological Analysis Reveals New Mesenchymal Patterns
- Based on the trichrome staining, we can see unique collagen patterns in labyrinth organ mesenchyme
- These patterns are closely associated with specific cell morphology

**Conclusion:** Labyrinth organ contains highly specific mesenchyme with potential organizing function.


## Labyrinth Organ Mesenchyme Has Distinctive Transcriptional Profile
- Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that labyrinth organ contains highly specific mesenchymal structures with a specific transcription profile

- Labyrinth organ exhibits specific expression of specific tissue organization genes such as *notch* genes or *wnt5a*

**Conclusion:** Transcriptionally distinct mesenchyme in labyrinth organ exhibits expression of tissue remodeling genes

**Evolutionary Similarities With Other Breathing Strategies**

- We implemented the SAMap algorithm to compare labyrinth organ to other respiratory adaptations – lungs from lungfish
- Labyrinth organ mesenchyme maps mostly to lungs alveolar cells

**Conclusion:** Labyrinth organ mesenchyme may have a similar evolutionary origin as other respiratory organs, while having unique phenotype
